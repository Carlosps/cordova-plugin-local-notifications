> A notification is a message you display to the user outside of your app's normal UI. When you tell the system to issue a notification, it first appears as an icon in the notification area. To see the details of the notification, the user opens the notification drawer. Both the notification area and the notification drawer are system-controlled areas that the user can view at any time.

## Upgrade Notice

In Version 1.1.0 some properties were changed. Please see [Changes since Version `1.1.0`](#changes-since-version-110)

## Basics

The plugin creates the object `cordova.plugins.notification.local` and is accessible after *deviceready* has been fired.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'My first notification',
    text: 'Thats pretty easy...'
});
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/ios-basic.png">
</p>

The plugin allows to schedule multiple notifications at once.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule([
    { id: 1, title: 'My first notification' },
    { id: 2, title: 'My first notification' }
]);
```

## Notification Limits
On each platform are limits about how much notifications can be scheduled:

- iOS: 64
- Android: 500

Repeating notifications count as 1 notification, except if you schedule with the [trigger count](#repeating) option on Android.

## Properties
A notification does have a set of configurable properties. See [documentation](#properties-3).

## Permissions
Each platform may require the user to grant permissions first before the app is allowed to schedule notifications. This is done automatically, when scheduling a notification. If you want do it manually, you can use [requestPermission](#requestpermission). Please keep in mind, that the user can still change the permission later in the system. If you want to check if you have still the permission to post notifications, use [hasPermission](#haspermission).

Example on iOS when requesting for permission:

![Requesting permission to post notifications on iOS](images/ios-permission.png)

## Android notification channels
Since Android 8 notification channels must be created to post noitifications. A [default channel](#android-default-channel) will be created for you, if you do not create one. You can also create your own channel by [createChannel](#createchannel) or when [scheduling a notification](#create-channel-by-posting-a-notification). For deleting a channel use [deleteChannel](#deletechannel).

## Android inexact and exact alarms
Since Android 13 notifications will be scheduled inexact by default. This means the notifications can be delayed by some minutes. If you want exact alarms, the user must grant the permission in the "Alarms & Reminders"-setting, which you can call by [openAlarmSettings](#openalarmsettings). To check, if exact alarms are permitted, you can use [canScheduleExactAlarms](#canscheduleexactalarms).

## Specials about Android

### App Update
When installing an update of your app, all notifications will be rescheduled by this plugin, because Android removes all scheduled alarms on an update.

### Device reboot
When the device reboots, all notifications will be rescheduled by the plugin, because Android cancels all alarams after a device reboot. If the user has setup a device lock, the user must first unlock this so the notifications can be rescheduled.

## Actions

The plugin knows two types of actions: _button_ and _input_.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'The big survey',
    text: 'Are you a fan of RB Leipzig?',
    attachments: ['www/img/rb-leipzig.jpg'],
    actions: [
        { id: 'yes', title: 'Yes' },
        { id: 'no',  title: 'No' }
    ]
});
```

<p align="center">
    <img width="31%" src="images/android-actions.png">
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    <img width="31%" src="images/ios-actions.png">
</p>

Icons on action buttons are not displayed anymore since Android 7, [see documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Action.Builder#Builder(int,%20java.lang.CharSequence,%20android.app.PendingIntent))

### Input

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Justin Rhyss',
    text: 'Do you want to go see a movie tonight?',
    actions: [{
        id: 'reply',
        type: 'input',
        title: 'Reply',
        emptyText: 'Type message',
    }, ... ]
});
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/android-reply.png">
</p>

It is recommended to pre-define action groups rather then specifying them with each new notification of the same type.


```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.addActions('yes-no', [
    { id: 'yes', title: 'Yes' },
    { id: 'no',  title: 'No'  }
]);
```

Once you have defined an action group, you can reference it when scheduling notifications:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Justin Rhyss',
    text: 'Do you want to go see a movie tonight?',
    actions: 'yes-no'
});
```

### Properties

Actions do have a set of configurable properties. Not all of them are supported across all platforms.

| Property     | Type         | Android | iOS |
| :----------- | :----------- | :------ | :-- |
| id           | button+input | x       | x   |
| title        | button+input | x       | x   |
| launch       | button+input | x       | x   |
| ui           | button+input |         | x   |
| needsAuth    | button+input |         | x   |
| icon         | button+input | x       |     |
| emptyText    | input        | x       | x   |
| submitTitle  | input        |         | x   |
| editable     | input        | x       |     |
| choices      | input        | x       |     |
| defaultValue | input        |         |     |


## Triggers

Notifications may trigger immediately or depend on calendar or location.

To trigger at a fix date:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Design team meeting',
    text: '3:00 - 4:00 PM',
    trigger: { at: new Date(2017, 10, 27, 15) }
});
```

Or relative from now:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Design team meeting',
    trigger: { in: 1, unit: 'hour' }
});
```

### Repeating

Repeat relative from now:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Design team meeting',
    trigger: { every: 'day', count: 5 }
});
```

Or trigger every time the date matches:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Happy Birthday!!!',
    trigger: { every: { month: 10, day: 27, hour: 9, minute: 0 } }
});
```

### Location based

To trigger when the user enters a region:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Welcome to our office',
    trigger: {
        type: 'location',
        center: [x, y],
        radius: 15,
        notifyOnEntry: true
    }
});
```

### Properties

The properties depend on the trigger type. Not all of them are supported across all platforms.

| Type         | Property      | Type    | Value            | Android | iOS |
| :----------- | :------------ | :------ | :--------------- | :------ | :-- |

## Progress
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only

Notifications can include an animated progress indicator that shows users the status of an ongoing operation.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Sync in progress',
    text: 'Copied 2 of 10 files',
    androidProgressBar: {
        value: 20, // Default 0
        maxValue: 100, // Default 100
        indeterminate: false // Default false
    }
});
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/android-progress.png">
</p>

Calls [NotificationCompat.Builder#setProgress(int,int,boolean)](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setProgress(int,int,boolean))

### Indeterminate Progress

Use indeterminate mode for the progress bar when you do not know how long an operation will take. It shows a cyclic animation without a specific amount of progress indicated.

See [ProgressBar#indeterminate-progress](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ProgressBar.html#indeterminate-progress)

### Determinate Progress

Use determinate mode for the progress bar when you want to show that a specific quantity of progress has occurred. For example, the percent remaining of a file being retrieved, the amount records in a batch written to database, or the percent remaining of an audio file that is playing.

See [ProgressBar#determinate-progress](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/ProgressBar.html#determinate-progress)

## Patterns
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only

Split the text by line breaks if the message comes from a single person and just too long to show in a single line.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'The Big Meeting',
    text: '4:15 - 5:15 PM\nBig Conference Room',
    androidSmallIcon: 'res://ic_menu_my_calendar',
    androidLargeIcon: 'res://large_icon'
});
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/android-inbox.png">
</p>

### Summarizing
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only

Instead of displaying multiple notifications, you can create one notification that summarizes them all.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    id: 15,
    title: 'Chat with Irish',
    androidLargeIcon: 'res://large_icon',
    androidMessages: [
        { person: 'Me', message: 'I miss you' },
        { person: 'Irish', message: 'I miss you more!' },
        { person: 'Me', message: 'I always miss you more by 10%' }
    ]
});
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/android-chat.png">
</p>

To add a new message to the existing chat:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.update({
    id: 15,
    androidMessages: [{ person: 'Irish', message: 'Bye bye' }]
});
```

For displaying the messages, [NotificationCompat.MessagingStyle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.MessagingStyle) will be used.
#### Available properties for `androidMessages`
```javascript
androidMessags: [
    {
        message: "The message", // Default is `null`
        date: 1234567890, // Timestamp in milliseconds for e.g. by Date.getTime(), default is System.currentTimeMillis()
        person: "Michael", // Default is `null`
        personIcon: "www/personIcon.png" // Default is `null`
    }
]
```

##### Property `personIcon`
Will be drawn as a circle icon.

Possible values:
- `res://personIcon.png` - Resource from the app bundle, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-res)
- `www/personIcon.png` - Resource from the `www` folder, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-www)
- `shared://personIcon.png` - Resource from the shared folder, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-shared)

### Grouping
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only

Your app can present multiple notifications as a single group:

- A parent notification displays a summary of its child notifications.
- The child notifications are presented without duplicate header information.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule([
    { id: 0, title: 'Design team meeting', ... },
    { id: 1, androidSummary: 'me@gmail.com', androidGroup: 'email', androidGroupSummary: true },
    { id: 2, title: 'Please take all my money', ... androidGroup: 'email' },
    { id: 3, title: 'A question regarding this plugin', ... androidGroup: 'email' },
    { id: 4, title: 'Wellcome back home', ... androidGroup: 'email' }
]);
```

<p align="center">
    <img src="images/android-stack.png">
</p>

## Android channels

### Default channel
The following settings will be used for the default Android channel.

```javascript
{
    androidChannelId: "default_channel",
    androidChannelName: "Default channel",
    androidChannelImportance: "IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT"
}
```

You can change the defaults by calling [setDefaults](#setdefaults) or you can overwrite them, when scheduling a notification or [creating a channel](#createchannel).

### Create channel by posting a notification
A channel can be created directly when posting a notification:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    id: 1,
    title: 'My first notification',
    androidChannelId: "my_channel_01",
    androidChannelName: "My Channel Name"
});
```

If you omit some channel properties the [default channel properties](#default-channel) will be used.

## Events

The following events are supported: `add`, `trigger`, `click`, `clear`, `cancel`, `update`, `clearall` and `cancelall`.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.on(event, callback, scope);
```

To unsubscribe from events:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.un(event, callback, scope);
```

__Note:__ You have to provide the exact same callback to `cordova.plugins.notification.local.un` as you provided to `cordova.plugins.notification.local.on` to make unsubscribing work.
Hence you should define your callback as a separate function, not inline. If you want to use `this` inside of your callback, you also have to provide `this` as `scope` to `cordova.plugins.notification.local.on`.

### Custom

The plugin also fires events specified by actions.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.schedule({
    title: 'Do you want to go see a movie tonight?',
    actions: [{ id: 'yes', title: 'Yes' }]
});
```

The name of the event is the id of the action.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.on('yes', function (notification, eopts) { ... });
```

### Fire manually

Not an official interface, however its possible to manually fire events.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.core.fireEvent(event, args);
```


## Launch Details

Check the `launchDetails` to find out if the app was launched by clicking on a notification.

```js
document.addEventListener('deviceready', function () {
    console.log(cordova.plugins.notification.local.launchDetails);
}, false);
```

It might be possible that the underlying framework like __Ionic__ is not compatible with the launch process defined by cordova. With the result that the plugin fires the click event on app start before the app is able to listen for the events.

Therefore its possible to fire the queued events manually by defining a global variable.

```js
window.skipLocalNotificationReady = true
```

Once the app and Ionic is ready, you can fire the queued events manually.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.fireQueuedEvents();
```


## Methods

All methods work asynchronous and accept callback methods.

Note: This list has still to be documented.

### canScheduleExactAlarms
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only

Checks if the user has enabled the "Alarms & Reminders"-setting. If not, the notificiatons will be scheduled inexact, which is still ok and will only be delayed by some minutes.
- On Android 11 and older, this method will always return `true` in the `successCallback`.
- On Android 12 the permission is granted by default
- On Android 13 and newer, the permission is not granted by default and have to be explicitly enabled by the user.

### createChannel
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only

Creates a channel, if it not already exists. A channel is not changeable, after it is created. This is a restriction by Android.
If a notification does not specify a [androidChannelId](#property-androidchannelid) a [default channel](#default-channel) will be used.

For setting the channel, use [androidChannelId](#property-androidchannelid) when scheduling a notification.

Overview of all properties for a channel:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.createChannel({
    androidChannelId: "my_channel_01", // string, to separate something in the id, use "_" instead of "-"
    androidChannelName: "My Channel Name", // string, defaults to "Default Channel"
    androidChannelDescription: "Description of channel", // string (optional)
    androidChannelImportance: "IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT", // string (optional), see property documentation for importance
    androidChannelEnableLights: true, // bool (optional), default is false
    androidChannelEnableVibration: true, // bool (optional), default is false
    sound: 'www/audio/ring.mp3', // string (optional), defaults to "default", which represents the default sound for a notification. If you set `null`, no sound will be set for the notification
    androidChannelSoundUsage: 5 // int (optional), default is USAGE_NOTIFICATION
  }, successCallback, this)
```

### deleteChannel
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only

Deletes a Android channel.

Example:

```javascript
cordova.plugins.notification.local.deleteChannel("my_channel_id", successCallback, this)
```

These will delete all associated notificiations for this channel. If you create a new channel with the same id, the deleted channel will be un-deleted with all of the same settings it had before it was deleted, see [NotificationManagerCompat.deleteNotificationChannel](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationManagerCompat#deleteNotificationChannel(java.lang.String))

### getDefaults

Returns the default values all properties on each platform.

Example:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.getDefaults();
```

### hasPermission
Checks if the app has permissions to post notifications.

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.hasPermission(function (granted) { ... });
```

### iOSClearBadge
Clears the badge.

### openAlarmSettings
<img src="images/android-icon.svg" width="16"> Android only. Since Android 12 (SDK 31).

Opens the "Alarms & Reminders"-settings as an Activity when running on Android 12 (SDK 31) or later, where the user can enable exact alarms. This method will not wait for the user to be returned back to the app. For this, the `resume`-event can be used. The callback will just return `OK`, after starting the activity.
- If the user grants permission, already inexact scheduled notifications will be rescheduled as exact alarms.
- If exact alarms were already granted and the user revokes it, the app will be killed and all scheduled notifications will be canceld. The app have to schedule the notifications as inexact alarms again, when the app is opened the next time, see https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/alarms/schedule#using-schedule-exact-permission.
- On Android older then 12, it will just call the `successCallback`, without doing anything. 

### openNotificationSettings
Opens the notifications settings of the app on Android 8 and newer. This method will not wait for the user to be returned back to the app. For this, the `resume`-event can be used.
- On Android, the callback will just return "OK", after starting the activity.
- On Android older then 8, it opens the app details.
- On iOS it's not possible to open the notification settings, it will open the app settings.

### requestPermission
Request permission to post notifications. This is called automatically by the plugin when scheduling notifications, but you can also request it manually before scheduling notifications:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.requestPermission(function (granted) { ... });
```

If this method is called, a dialog will be shown to the user to ask for the permission.

Example on iOS when requesting for permission:

![Requesting permission to post notifications on iOS](images/ios-permission.png)

The user can still allow/deny the permission through the system settings.

To check if permissions are granted, without calling this method, use [hasPermission](#haspermission).

### setDefaults

Changes default values of properties.

Example:

```js
cordova.plugins.notification.local.setDefaults({
    androidChannelId: "my_channel_01",
    title: "My default Title"
});
```

| :---------------------- | :---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| vibrate                 | androidChannelEnableVibration | The vibration cannot be controlled on iOS. So this is a Android only property and can only be set on a channel. See [androidChannelEnableVibration](#property-androidchannelenablevibration)|

#### iOS
- Show a notification always in the notification center like on Android, also if [iOSForeground](#property-iosforeground) is `false`.

### Common properties

These properties can be used on all platforms, but some may behave differently on each platform.

- The vibration cannot be turned off separately. It can only be turned off, if no sound is set.

### Default values

Default values for the properties can be get by [getDefaults](#getdefaults).
Values can be changed by [setDefaults](#setdefaults)

### Available properties

#### Property `androidAllowWhileIdle`
Default: `false`

Alarm will be allowed to execute even when the system is in low-power idle (a.k.a. doze) modes.

This type of alarm must only be used for situations where it is actually required that the alarm go off while in idle -- a reasonable example would be for a calendar notification that should make a sound so the user is aware of it. When the alarm is dispatched, the app will also be added to the system's temporary power exemption list for approximately 10 seconds to allow that application to acquire further wake locks in which to complete its work.

This executes [AlarmManager.setAndAllowWhileIdle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)) or [AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)) depending on [canScheduleExactAlarms](#canscheduleexactalarms).

#### Property `androidAlarmType`
Default: `RTC_WAKEUP`

If the alarm should be scheduled on a specific time or in relevance to the time, when the device was booted and if the alarm should wakeup the device cpu (not the screen).

| Value            | Support | Description |
|:-----------------|:--------|:------------|
| [RTC_WAKEUP](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#RTC_WAKEUP) | x | Alarm time in `System.currentTimeMillis()` (wall clock time in UTC), which will wake up the device (the CPU not the screen) when it goes off. |
| [RTC](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#RTC) | x | Alarm time in `System.currentTimeMillis()` (wall clock time in UTC). This alarm does not wake the device up; if it goes off while the device is asleep, it will not be delivered until the next time the device wakes up. |
| [ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#ELAPSED_REALTIME_WAKEUP) | - | Alarm time in `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` (time since boot, including sleep), which will wake up the device (the CPU, not the screen) when it goes off. |
| [ELAPSED_REALTIME](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#ELAPSED_REALTIME) | - | Alarm time in `SystemClock.elapsedRealtime()` (time since boot, including sleep). This alarm does not wake the device up; if it goes off while the device is asleep, it will not be delivered until the next time the device wakes up. |

#### Property `androidChannelEnableVibration`
Default: `false`

Sets the vibration of a [notification channel](#create-channel) by setting [NotificationChannel#enableVibration(boolean)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/NotificationChannel#enableVibration(boolean)). On Android 7 this sets the vibration of a notification directly.

#### Property `androidChannelId`
Default: `default_channel`

Sets the `channelId` for the notification to be posted on. Use [Snake Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_case) for the id, which means, the id should be written in lowercase and words should be separated by underscores (`_`) and not hyphens (`-`) or whitespaces.

#### Property `androidChannelImportance`
Default: `"IMPORTANCE_DEFAULT"`

The property can have one of the following values:

| Value            | Description |
|:-----------------|:------------|

See [Android Documentation](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/AudioAttributes.Builder#setUsage(int))

#### Property `androidColor`
Default: `null`

The notification background color for the small icon. The color will only be applied on the notification style and not on the status bar.
Set as Hex-String like `#FF0000`. Calls [Notification.Builder#setColor](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder#setColor(int)), which sets [Notification#color](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#color). 

#### Property `androidLargeIcon`
Default: `null`

Add a large icon to the notification content view. In the platform template, this image will be shown either on the right of the notification, with an aspect ratio of up to 16:9, or (when the notification is grouped) on the left in place of the small icon. Calls [Notification.Builder#setLargeIcon(android.graphics.Bitmap)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder#setLargeIcon(android.graphics.Bitmap)).

Examples:
- `res://myLargeIcon.png` - Resource from the app bundle, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-res)
- `www/myLargeIcon.png` - `www` folder, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-file)
- `shared://myLargeIcon.png` - Shared folder, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-shared), Android only

#### Property `androidSmallIcon`
Default: `res://ic_popup_reminder` (=Bell icon)

Sets the small icon resource, which will be used to represent the notification in the status bar. Since Android 8, the icon must be a monochrome icon, which can only use a white color on a transparent background. The icon will be colored by the system in respective circumstances. You can also use a vector drawable, but only for a `res:\\` paths. You can get vector drawables on [Google Fonts Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons) as example or for using it. Just select the download for Android. To know, what vector drawables are, see the Android documentation [Vector drawables overview](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/vector-drawable-resources).

The platform template for the expanded view will draw this icon in the left, unless a large icon has also been specified, in which case the small icon will be moved to the right-hand side. Calls [Notification.Builder#setSmallIcon(int)](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification.Builder#setSmallIcon(int)).

Example: `res://myIcon.png` - Resource from the app bundle, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-res)

Only `res://` paths are allowed.

#### Property `androidSummary`
Default: `null`

Used in the following cases:

1. For [NotificationCompat.InboxStyle#setSummaryText(java.lang.CharSequence)](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.InboxStyle#setSummaryText(java.lang.CharSequence)), when using [NotificationCompat.InboxStyle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.InboxStyle), which happens, when the `text` property has line breaks.
2. For [NotificationCompat.BigPictureStyle#setSummaryText(java.lang.CharSequence)](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.BigPictureStyle#setSummaryText(java.lang.CharSequence)), when [NotificationCompat.BigPictureStyle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.BigPictureStyle) is used, which happens, when `attachments` are used. If `androidSummary` is not set, `text` will be used.
3. For [NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle#setSummaryText(java.lang.CharSequence)](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle#setSummaryText(java.lang.CharSequence)), when [NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.BigTextStyle) is used, which happens, if the `text` property is longer then 44 characters.

#### Property `attachments`
Default: `[]`

List of resources, to attach to the notification.

##### Android
Only the first entry will be used as a [bigPicture](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.BigPictureStyle#bigPicture(android.graphics.Bitmap)) of [NotificationCompat.BigPictureStyle](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.BigPictureStyle).

Support resource patterns:
- [res://](#resource-pattern-res)
- [shared://](#resource-pattern-shared)
- [www](#resource-pattern-www)

##### iOS
The visual and audio attachments to display alongside the notification’s main content, see documentation of [UNMutableNotificationContent.attachments](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unmutablenotificationcontent/attachments).

Support resource patterns:
- `file:///` - Absolute file path
- [res://](#resource-pattern-res) - App resource
- [www](#resource-pattern-www)
- `base64://` - Base64 string

#### Property `badgeNumber`
Default:
- Android: `1` - Each notification increments the badge count by 1
- iOS: `-1` - Does not set any badge

Set the badge count. The behavior differs on Android and iOS.

##### Android
Sets the number of items a notification represents. If the value is `1`, each notification increments the badge of the application by one. If 3 notifications are posted, the badge count will be `3`.

On newer Android versions, the badge count will be presented as a dot and shows the number, if you long press on the app icon.

For using the badge, see the Android documentation [Modify a notification badge](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/notifications/badges).

Calls [NotificationCompat.Builder#setNumber(int)](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/NotificationCompat.Builder#setNumber(int)).

##### iOS
A notification does not increment the badge, it sets the badge count directly. If 3 notifications are posted with the value of `1`, the badge count will be `1` and not `3`.

Specials of this value:
- `-1`: The badge  will not be changed.
- `0`: The badge will be cleared.

Sets [UNMutableNotificationContent#badge](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unmutablenotificationcontent/badge).

###### Clearing the badge
You can clear the badge with the function [iOSClearBadge](#iosclearbadge).

The badge will also be cleared, if you call `clearAll` or `cancelAll`.

#### Property `iOSForeground`
Default: `true`

Displays a notification banner when the app is in foreground, otherwise the notification could only make a noise (sound and vibrate), change the badge, but is not shown as a banner. Since iOS 14, the notification is always displayed in the Notification Center, no matter how this option is set to be consistent with Android. Renamed from `foreground` to `iOSForeground` and changed to `true` by default in Version `1.1.0`.

#### Property `priority`
Default: `0` (=PRIORITY_DEFAULT)

Deprecated since Android 8.

Replaced by [androidChannelImportance](#property-androidchannelimportance), which sets also the [priority](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#priority) value for notifications on Android 7.

This property had aditional functionality for the plugin, which is replaced by [androidAlarmType](#property-androidalarmtype) and [androidAllowWhileIdle](#property-androidallowwhileidle).

##### Old use case
When the value was [PRIORITY_MIN](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#PRIORITY_MIN)(=-2), the alarm was scheduled with [RTC](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#RTC).
This can now be achieved by setting [androidAlarmType](#property-androidalarmtype) to `RTC` and [androidAllowWhileIdle](#property-androidallowwhileidle) to false.

When the value was [PRIORITY_DEFAULT](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#PRIORITY_DEFAULT)(=0), which was set as the default for this plugin, the alarm was scheduled with [RTC_WAKEUP](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#RTC_WAKEUP). This can now be set by [androidAlarmType](#property-androidalarmtype).

When the value was [PRIORITY_MAX](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Notification#PRIORITY_MAX)(=2), the alarm was scheduled by [AlarmManager.setAndAllowWhileIdle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)) or [AlarmManager.setExactAndAllowWhileIdle](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/AlarmManager#setExactAndAllowWhileIdle(int,%20long,%20android.app.PendingIntent)). This can now be set by [androidAllowWhileIdle](#property-androidallowwhileidle).

#### Property `sound`
Default: `default`

The value `default` sets the system default sound for a notification. The value `null` will disable the sound.
On Android it sets the sound of a notification channel. On iOS it enables/disables also the vibration.

Example:
- `res://mySound.wav` - Resource from the app bundle, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-res)
- `shared://mySound.wav` - Shared folder, see [documentation](#resource-pattern-shared), Android only
- `www/mySound.wav` - [Documentation](#resource-pattern-file)

##### Android
Before Android 8 it sets the sound of a notification. Since Android 8 it sets the sound of a [notification channel](#create-channel).

##### iOS
Enables/disables also the vibration. If no sound is set, no vibration will occur.

You can package the audio data in an `aiff`, `wav`, or `caf` file. Sound files must be less than 30 seconds in length.
If the sound file is longer than 30 seconds, the system plays the default sound instead. See [UNNotificationSound - Prepare Sound Resources](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationsound?language=objc#Prepare-Sound-Resources).

The system looks in the following folders for the file:
- The `/Library/Sounds` directory of the app’s container directory.
- The `/Library/Sounds` directory of one of the app’s shared group container directories.
- The main bundle of the current executable.

See documentation [UNNotificationSound#soundNamed](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationsound/init(named:)?language=objc#Discussion).

### Resource resolving

If a property can take a resource, the following patterns could be used. Not all patterns are available for every property.

#### Resource pattern `file://`
Example: `file://myImage.png`

Looks for a file in the `www` folder. `file://myImage.png` is equivalent to `www/myImage.png`.

#### Resource pattern `www/`
Example: `www/myImage.png`

Looks for a file in the `www` folder.

#### Resource pattern `res://`
Example: `res://myImage.png`

Defines a resource for Android or iOS. In Android it looks in the app's `res` folder, in iOS it looks for a file in the root of the app package.

##### Android
Gets a resource from the `res` directory of your app or the system resources. Normally, when getting a resource file on Android, the resource name should not contain the file extension like `res://myImage`, but, to be compatible with iOS, you can also include the extension like `res://myImage.png`. An explanation what the `res`directory is, can be read in the Android documentation [Providing Resources](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/resources/providing-resources).

The property, which you use, defines, in which subfolder of `res` the resource should be:
- For a graphic: `drawable` and `mipmap`
- For a sound: `raw`

The plugin trys first to get the resource from you app package, if it does not find one there, it trys to get it from the [system resources](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/res/Resources#getSystem()).

If you want to use a system resource, you have to use a valid resource identifier, which you can look for in [Android Code Search](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/base/core/res/res/). An example would be [ic_popup_reminder](https://cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/base/core/res/res/drawable-mdpi/ic_popup_reminder.png), which you would set with `res://ic_popup_reminder`.

To make files files available in the `res` directory, you can use the [resource-file](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/12.x/config_ref/#resource-file) tag in `config.xml` like:

```xml
<platform name="android">
    <resource-file src="res/drawable/myImage.png" target="app/src/main/res/drawable/myImage.png" />
    <resource-file src="res/raw/mySound.wav" target="app/src/main/res/raw/mySound.wav" />
</platform>
``` 

The directory structure for this example would be:
```
|- res
   |- drawable
       |- myImage.png 
   |- raw
       |- mySound.wav
|- config.xml
|- plugins
|- platforms
...
```

##### iOS
Looks for a file in the root of the app package.

For e.g.:
`res://AppIcon60x60@3x.png` would point to `YourApp.ipa/AppIcon60x60@3x.png` on a release build or `YourApp.app/AppIcon60x60@3x.png` on a debug build. The app container is a zip file. On a mac, you can right click on your app container and choose `Show package contents`.

To copy files to the app bundle, use the [resource-file](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/12.x/config_ref/#resource-file) tag in your `config.xml` like:

```xml
<platform name="ios">
    <resource-file src="res/myAudio.wav" target="myAudio.wav" />
</platform>
```

The directory structure for the example would be:
```
|- res
   |- myAudio.wav
|- config.xml
|- plugins
|- platforms
...
```

#### Resource pattern `shared://`
Example: `shared://myImage.png`

Android only.

##### Android
A shared file in `[Installed-App-Path]/files/shared_files`. This is necessary to get useable Uris for asset files, which are the files of the `www` directory. You can also use the `shared_files` directory, to store files created on runtime. To access the directory, you can use [cordova.file.dataDirectory](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file#where-to-store-files) of the plugin [cordova-plugin-file](https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-file) and write to the folder `shared_files`. The folder `shared_files` will be created on plugin initialization.
